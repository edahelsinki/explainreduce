# ExplainReduce: Summarising local explanations via proxies
ExplainReduce is a global, model-agnostic, and post-hoc explanation method that extracts a small set of 'proxies' from a large collection of local models generated by local explanation methods (e.g., LIME and SHAP). Each proxy is a representative local model that effectively captures the prediction behaviour of the black-box model within a specific neighbourhood. The set of proxies summarizes the black-box model's decision pattern across different regions of the input space, facilitating global interpretability. An example is shown below.
