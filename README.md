# ExplainReduce: Summarising local explanations via proxies
ExplainReduce is a global, model-agnostic, and post-hoc explanation method that extracts a small set of 'proxies' from a large collection of local models generated by local explanation methods (e.g., LIME and SHAP).
Each proxy is a representative local model that effectively captures the prediction behaviour of the black-box model within a specific neighbourhood.
The set of proxies summarizes the black-box model's decision pattern across different regions of the input space, facilitating global interpretability.

## Installation
ExplainReduce requires Python 3, version 3.11 or greater.
To install python, follow the instructions from the official website of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
For package management, we recommend the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager.
You can install the dependencies by running
```
uv sync
```
after cloning the repository.
Alternatively, install the requirements via pip with
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, create a copy of `config.template` named `config.ini` at the root of this repository.
Clone the [GLocalX repository](https://github.com/msetzu/glocalx) using
```
git clone git@github.com:msetzu/glocalx.git
```
and enter the path to that directory to `config.ini`:
```
[Paths]
GLOCALX_PATH = /your/path/to/glocalx
```

Finally, for downloading [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/) datasets, add your OpenML API key to `config.ini`:
```
[Keys]
OPENML_APIKEY = your_openml_api_key
```


## Example
A simple example of the idea behind ExplainReduce. A black-box model (left) can have many local explanations (middle), but ExplainReduce can reduce the size of the local explanation set to get a global explanation consisting of two simple models (right).
